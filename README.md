dice is an iOS application (called "ProDice" on App Store) that uses SceneKit to do the physics of rolling various dice: coins, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20. 

Tapping, swiping and curly swiping on the Table drops, throws and spin dice. One can also assign "actions" for tapping, double tapping, triple tapping, long tapping and pinching individual die.

One can set the size of the dice, the default throwing strength, if held/selected die should pulse, the number of undo and keeping track of throw history.

It also includes a few dice games. Works well on either iPhone or iPad.
